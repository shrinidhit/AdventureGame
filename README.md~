Type "help" at any time for a list of verbs and what they do!

We thought the assignment was really fun and a reasonable amount of work. It made us want to make our own adventure games from scratch.  :)



For Part 3, we implemented the following extensions:

	- Ability to talk to NPCs. You can choose one of 4 phrases to say to an NPC, and they will respond appropriately based on their "personality".  See responses.py and the talk() method in verbs.py for more info.

	- Ability to take courses. There are 4 courses placed in the classrooms of the AC, and upon taking all four, the player will complete a semster at Olin and win the game. See courses.py for more info.

	- Sleeping.  The player starts with 50 health. Every round, the player loses 1 health.  Upon taking a class, the player loses 10 health.  When the player's health starts to get low, they will say something about how sleepy they are. The player can go to any dorm room in West Hall or East Hall to sleep. They will wake up the next round with their health restored. See the sleep() method in verbs.py and sleeproom.py for more info.
